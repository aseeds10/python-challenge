This repo has submission for PyPoll and PyBank tasks.
I used Xpert Learning Assistant for help debugging and with templates/concepts.
You can view the My Notes doc to see areas in which I used the learning asisstant and some of my thought proceess.
I also had a physical notebook I used to write my brainstorms.

PLEASE NOTE 1:
Please make sure to naviagte to current cd in terminal so it can run smoothly.
I had to do that at the start of running the code for the first time or else I would get a 'file not found' message.

PLEASE NOTE 2: I was not sure how to create a new .txt file from scrtach with the script, so please create a blank .txt file
with the appropriate name to hold the results in my analysis.

Thank you!
